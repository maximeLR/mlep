    """
    Model training pipeline recipe.

    This is a recipe for a pipeline that loads the data, processes it and
    splits it into train and test sets, then trains and evaluates a model
    on it. It is agnostic of the actual step implementations and just defines
    how the artifacts are circulated through the steps by calling them in the
    right order and passing the output of one step as the input of the next
    step.

    The arguments that this function takes are instances of the steps that
    are defined in the steps folder. Also note that the arguments passed to
    the steps are step artifacts. If you use step parameters to configure the
    steps, they must not be used here, but instead be used when the steps are
    instantiated, before this function is called.

    Args:
        data_loader: A data loader step instance that outputs a dataset.
        data_processor: A data processor step instance that takes a dataset
            as input and outputs a processed dataset.
        data_splitter: A data splitter step instance that takes a dataset
            as input and outputs a train and test set split.
        model_trainer: A model trainer step instance that takes a train set
            as input and outputs a trained model.
        model_evaluator: A model evaluator step instance that takes a train/test
            set split and a trained model as input and outputs model evaluation
            metrics.
