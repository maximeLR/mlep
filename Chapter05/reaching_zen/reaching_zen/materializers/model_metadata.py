    """Custom materializer for the `ModelMetadata` artifact data type.

    A materializer instructs ZenML about how to store (de-materialize)
    the information from an artifact data type (ModelMetadata in this example)
    into the artifact store and, conversely, loading (materializing) it back
    into the artifact data type. Take a look at the `artifacts` folder for
    additional information about custom artifact data types.

    When using custom data types for your artifacts, you must also supply
    a custom materializer class that implements two simple I/O operations:

     - saving an artifact object to the the artifact store
     - loading an artifact object from the artifact store

    For both of these operations, the ZenML framework supplies a URI
    (`self.uri`) identifying the location in the artifact store where the
    artifact is/should be located. Implementing them means transferring
    the in-memory data stored in the artifact to the provided URI and
    vice-versa. ZenML puts at your disposal a series of I/O utilities capable of
    universally handling these URLs in the `zenml.io.fileio`,
    `zenml.utils.io_utils` and `zenml.utils.yaml_utils` Python modules.

    More information about custom step artifact data types and ZenML
    materializers is available in the docs:

      https://docs.zenml.io/advanced-guide/pipelines/materializers

        This operation takes the information in the artifact (`model_metadata`)
        and stores it in the artifact store at the `self.uri` URI location.

        This is usually implemented in one of two ways:

        - shown here: using the `zenml.io.fileio.open()` function or one of the
        `zenml.utils.yaml_utils` wrappers to write the artifact data
        directly to a file in the artifact store, similar to how you would use
        the standard `open()` Python I/O.
        - saving the artifact to a temporary location on your local filesystem
        and then copying it to the artifact store using the `zenml.io.fileio`
        functions (e.g. `mkdir()`, `copy()`). This last method is used in
        cases where artifact data types come from 3rd party libraries that are
        not directly aware of ZenML's I/O and cannot be modified to use it.
